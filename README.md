# Programming-workshop
my first programming workshop project.
I want to build a futter app that will have a database integrated in it.
right now i think of using a firebase DB
the DB will get it's data both from the users and from the web.
in specific, it will get it's data from public XML files that supermarkets publish Continuously.
**************************************************************************************************
the project will have an unknowm numper of parts:
1) an Integrative application.
2) A program in the cloud that will periodically check publication of XML files and update their content in a database

***************************************************************************************************************************************
the endgame is to make a supermarket app that will work with the supermarket Cash register and will fasten the customer line
